# Django Image API

## Description

This project was created while following
[codewithmosh.com's](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-django-series)
Ultimate Django Series.

In part 3, we learn about advanced concepts regarding Django utilities. One of
the sections is about file handling and we learn how to create an Image Upload
API.

Even though i've worked with Django professionally, I learned some interesting
things that should help in the future.

This repository will serve as good reference when I need refresher on how to
handle image files in Django.
